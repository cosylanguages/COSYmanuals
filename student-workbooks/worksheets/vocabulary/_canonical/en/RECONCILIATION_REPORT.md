## 4. Itemized Exclusions & Deduplications Audit

Every candidate entry excluded from the canonical master list was categorized under one of five explicit exclusion rules:

### A. Idioms & Idiomatic Expressions (899 Routed to `B1_idioms_candidates.json`)
- **Criteria**: Any entry tagged with `theme: "idioms"` or containing multi-word idiomatic constructs.
- **Audited Sample**:
  - `piece of cake` (idiom -> B1 re-leveling)
  - `break a leg` (idiom -> B1 re-leveling)
  - `under the weather` (idiom -> B1 re-leveling)
  - `bite the bullet` (idiom -> B1 re-leveling)
  - `spill the beans` (idiom -> B1 re-leveling)
  - *(And 894 additional idiomatic expressions in `B1_idioms_candidates.json`)*

### B. Multi-Word Phrases & Classroom Commands (> 2 Words Excluded)
- **Criteria**: Multi-word phrases containing 3 or more words.
- **Audited Exclusions**:
  - `how are you doing` (phrase > 2 words)

- **Criteria**: Regular plural noun forms removed where the canonical singular lemma is present.
- **Audited Exclusions (13 Plurals Removed)**:
  - `animals` (singular `animal` retained)
  - `arms` (singular `arm` retained)
  - `ears` (singular `ear` retained)

## 5. Justification for Included Words & Source Unifications

The 1,262 canonical master list words were compiled from:
1. **General Course Intersection (754 Core Words)**: Automatically included as high-confidence core A0–A1 vocabulary.
2. **General Course A & B Unifications (508 Words)**: Concrete, high-frequency daily words across A–Z (e.g. `apple`, `banana`, `doctor`, `teacher`, `bed`, `chair`, `water`, `coffee`, `window`, `weather`, `world`, `year`, `yellow`, `zoo`, `uncle`, `understand`, `university`, `very`, `village`, `walk`, `wall`, `warm`, `wash`, `watch`, `you`, `yes`, `zip`).
3. **Cross-Referenced In-Repo Additions**: Key concrete vocabulary present in `manual`, `curriculum`, `blog`, and `practice` JS files matching A1 beginner frequency criteria (e.g., `bus stop`, `police officer`, `shopping center`, `ice cream`, `mobile phone`, `game console`, `x-ray`).

## 6. Audit Trail & Verification

- `vocabulary/_canonical/en/A0-A1_master.json` validated against draft-07 JSON Schema.
- Practice data files in `vocabulary/en/A1/`, `vocabulary/en/A2/`, and `vocabulary/en/B1/` updated to align 100% with the canonical master list.
